# Some_C_Sort_Algorithms

This project provides C implementations of fundamental sorting algorithms, demonstrating their practical application and performance characteristics.

Algorithms Included:

* **Bubble Sort (Optimized):** Time complexity O(n^2). Suitable for small datasets.
* **Merge Sort:** Time complexity O(n log n). Efficient for large datasets.
* **Quick Sort:** Time complexity O(n log n) (average case). Generally very fast.
* **Heap Sort:** Time complexity O(n log n). Guaranteed performance.

Choosing the right sorting algorithm depends on the size of the dataset. For small datasets, the simplicity of Bubble Sort might be adequate. However, for larger datasets, the O(n log n) algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort) offer significantly better performance. This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding and comparing these sorting algorithms in C.
